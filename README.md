# Hubot Nextbus (Nashville)

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/hubot-nextbus.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/hubot-nextbus) [![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/stephenyeargin/hubot-nextbus.png)](https://app.travis-ci.com/stephenyeargin/hubot-nextbus)

This Hubot package is a Nashville, Tennessee MTA bus tracker. You provide an API key and a latitude and longitude for it to obtain the next expect bus to a particular set of nearby stops.

## Getting Started

The first step is to get an API key for this service. As it is currently in a private beta, you'll have to [ask the creator nicely](https://nextbus.jt2k.com/about). He's a swell guy.

## Installation

In your hubot repository, run:

`npm install hubot-nextbus --save`

Then add **hubot-nextbus** to your `external-scripts.json`:

```json
["hubot-nextbus"]
```
